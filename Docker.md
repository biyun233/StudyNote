# Docker



## Vitrual Machines VS Containers

### Problems of VMS

- Each VM needs a full-blown OS
- Slow to start
- Resource intensive 资源密集型
  - each VM takes a slice of the actual physical hardware resources like cpu, memory and disk space

### Container

- Allow running multiple apps in isolation
- Lightweight
- Use OS of the host
- Start quickly
- Need less hardware resources



## Docker Architecture

- Windows
  - Windows and linux container
- Linux
  - linux container
- Mac OS
  - Use a lightweight linux VM to run linux container
